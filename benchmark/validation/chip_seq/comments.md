Legacy BWA alignment used `bwa aln` alignment - this has been deprecated for `bwa mem`. See the BWA-MEM paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3997).

This difference in aligners accounts for the mean unexplained variance (~1.1%) between the [binned spatial signal](spatial_corr.pdf) of the two workflows.
