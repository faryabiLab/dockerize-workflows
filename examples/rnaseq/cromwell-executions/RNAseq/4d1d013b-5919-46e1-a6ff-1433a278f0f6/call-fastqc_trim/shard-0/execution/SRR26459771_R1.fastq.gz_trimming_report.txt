SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /mnt/data0/noah/data/sra/rna/SRR26459771/SRR26459771_R1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 3.5
Python version: 3.10.12
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 15
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 56457). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 23)
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 5 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
