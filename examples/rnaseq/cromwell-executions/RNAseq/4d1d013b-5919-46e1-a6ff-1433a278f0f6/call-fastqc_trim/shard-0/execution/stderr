Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 3.5
Cutadapt seems to be using Python 3! Proceeding with multi-core enabled Cutadapt using 8 cores
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 8 cores

Proceeding with 'pigz -p 4' for decompression
To decrease CPU usage of decompression, please install 'igzip' and run again

Using user-specified basename (>>SRR26459771<<) instead of deriving the filename from the input file(s)


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /mnt/data0/noah/data/sra/rna/SRR26459771/SRR26459771_R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	56457	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	5.65
Nextera	23	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	7	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 56457). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 23)

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /mnt/data0/noah/data/sra/rna/SRR26459771/SRR26459771_R1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 3.5
Python version: 3.10.12
Number of cores used for trimming: 8
Quality Phred score cutoff: 15
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 5 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Cutadapt seems to be fairly up-to-date (version 3.5). Setting -j 8
Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to SRR26459771_R1_trimmed.fq.gz
